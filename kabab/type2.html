    <h1>Chapli Kabab</h1>
    <p>
        Chapli Kabab is a flavorful and aromatic Pakistani and Afghan ground meat kebab made with minced meat (usually beef, mutton, or chicken) and a variety of spices. It is known for its crispy texture on the outside while remaining tender and juicy on the inside. The name "Chapli" comes from the word "Chapli," which means "flat" in Pashto, referring to the flattened shape of these kababs.</p>
