    <h1>Shami Kabab</h1>
    <p>
        Shami Kebab is a popular Pakistani and Indian dish made with ground meat (usually beef, mutton, or chicken), lentils, and a blend of spices. Unlike other types of kebabs, Shami Kebab is typically softer, thanks to the addition of lentils and the slow-cooking process. It is often served as a snack or appetizer and is loved for its rich flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture.</p>
