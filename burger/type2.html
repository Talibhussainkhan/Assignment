    <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>
    <p>A chicken burger is a type of burger made with a chicken patty instead of the traditional beef patty. The patty can be made from ground chicken or a whole chicken breast, either grilled, fried, or baked. Chicken burgers are a popular alternative to beef burgers, offering a leaner protein option.</p>
