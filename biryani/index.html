    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is \
        mainly made with rice, a choice of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, \
        prawn, or fish) and lots of seasonings and spices. To cater to vegetarians \
        in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1]
         Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.[2]</p>
