    <h1>Rolls</h1>
    <p>
        A roll is a type of bread, typically round or oval in shape, that is often smaller than a loaf of bread. Rolls are commonly served as individual portions and are used in various meals, either as a side or as the base for sandwiches and burgers. They come in different textures, flavors, and types depending on the ingredients and baking method.</p>
