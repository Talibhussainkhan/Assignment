    <h1>Nihari</h1>
    <p>Nihari is a flavorful, slow-cooked meat stew that originated in the Indian subcontinent:</p>
    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>The name comes from the Arabic word nahaar, which means "morning". Nihari was originally eaten in the morning as a breakfast dish by Mughal nawabs and laborers. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients
    </h3>
    <p>Nihari is typically made with beef shank, but can also be made with lamb, goat, 
        chicken, or camel meat. The stew is thickened with atta, an Indian and Pakistani 
        durum whole wheat flour, and flavored with long pepper, a relative of black pepper.
