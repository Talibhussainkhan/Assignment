    <h1>Karahi</h1>
    <p>Karahi (also spelled kadhai or kadai) is a popular and traditional dish in South Asian cuisine, particularly in Pakistan, India, and parts of Afghanistan. It refers both to the cooking vessel (a type of wok) and the dish that is cooked in it. The dish is typically made with meat (such as chicken, beef, mutton, or even fish) cooked in a rich, flavorful curry sauce, which is often spiced with a variety of aromatic ingredients.</p>
